# PulseAudio module configuration to fix audio crackling
# on MediaTek Helio A22 (MT8166B) audio codec
#
# The crackling is caused by timer-based scheduling (tsched)
# not working well with the MT8166 ALSA driver. Disabling tsched
# forces interrupt-based scheduling which is more reliable.
#
# Install:
#   sudo cp 99-fix-crackling.pa /etc/pulse/default.pa.d/
